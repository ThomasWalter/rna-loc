# RNA localization in smFISH images
This is a collection of analysis tools to study RNA localization from smFISH images.
We use a number of different open-source software packages, and detail their usage in this documentation.

[**ImJoy**](https://imjoy.io) is image processing platform with an easy to use interface powered by a Python engine running in the background.

[**FISH-quant**](https://bitbucket.org/muellerflorian/fish_quant/) is a Matlab toolbox to localize RNAs in 3D from smFISH images.

## Getting started

### ImJoy: install the Plugin Engine
To run the ImJoy plugins, you will also need the **Plugin Engine**. It allows to
perform analysis in Python. You will need to install it only once, it will then
automatically check for updates each time you launch it. We provid the [**Plugin Engine for different operating systems**](https://github.com/oeway/ImJoy-Python/releases)


### ImJoy: install plugins
We provide links to install the different ImJoy plugins in dedicated ImJoy workspaces.
If you press such a link the ImJoy web app will open and display a dialog asking if you want to install the specified plugin. To confirm, press the `install` button.
