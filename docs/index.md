# RNA localization in smFISH images
This is a collection of analysis tools to study RNA localization from smFISH images.
We use a number of different open-source software packages, and detail their usage in this documentation.

[**ImJoy**](https://imjoy.io) is image processing platform with an easy to use interface powered by a Python engine running in the background.
